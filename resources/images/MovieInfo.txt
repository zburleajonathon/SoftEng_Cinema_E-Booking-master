	Description:
		"Fox has been asking for a PG-13 basically since the start in 2006," Ryan Reynolds told 
		Deadline. "I've said no since 2006. Now, this one time, I said 'Yes' on two conditions. First, 
		a portion of the proceeds had to go to charity. Second, I wanted to kidnap Fred Savage. The 
		second condition took some explaining..."Fred Savage will join Reynolds in new scenes for ONCE 
		UPON A DEADPOOL in an homage to Savage's starring role in the 1987 bedtime-story classic THE 
		PRINCESS BRIDE. Fred remarked, "while my participation in this film was anything but voluntary, 
		I am happy to learn that Fudge Cancer will be the beneficiary of this shameless cash grab".
